# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Problem Statement

Churn is a one of the biggest problems in the telecom industry. Research has shown that the average monthly churn rate among the top 4 wireless carriers in the US is 1.9% - 2%.
The retention and acquisition of users are the major concerns in telecom industry. The fast growth of marketplace in every business is giving rise to increased subscriber base. Accordingly, companies have recognized the significance of retaining the customers who is on hand. It has become necessary for service-providers to reduce the churn rate of customers since the inattention might negatively influence profitability of the company. Churn prediction contributes to identify those users who are likely to switch a company over another. Telecom is enduring the problem of ever-increasing churn rate.
Accordingly, the current study employs machine learning algorithm on big-data platform. Machine learning algorithm techniques facilitate these telecom firms to be protected with efficient approaches for lessening the rate of churn. Silent churn is one type which is considered complicated to predict since there might have such kind of users who might probably churns in the near future.
It must be the aim of the decision-maker and advertisers to lessen the churn ratio since it is a recognized fact that comparatively 4 existing customers are the most beneficial resources for companies than acquiring new one.

- Aims and objectives-
- To explore the customer churn prediction in telecom using machine learning
- To compare the algorithms that are effective in reducing churn rate in telecom companies
